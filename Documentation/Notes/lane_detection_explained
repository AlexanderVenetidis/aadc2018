Implementation of Lane detection by Audi:
- load the image form the camera as cv::mat
- turn the image into gray scale
- load mat as vector and then traverse row by row to detect change in brightness (compared with a constant value defined in header)
- the line width is determined by the distance between the ramp up and ramp down point
